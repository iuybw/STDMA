# Spatio-temporal Differential Memory Attention Model for Traffic Flow Prediction (STDMA)

## 📂 Repository Status

🚧 **Important Notice**

- The **core model implementation will be released after the paper is officially accepted**.
- In the early stage, we named the model Differential Memory Transformer (DMT), so both the model files and class names were set to dmt.
## 📊 Datasets

The experiments in the paper are conducted on commonly used public traffic datasets, such as:

- PEMS03
- PEMS04
- PEMS08
- SD

## 🔧 Requirements

The final implementation will be based on:

- Python ≥ 3.10
- PyTorch ≥ 2.1.1

A complete environment configuration will be released together with the model code.
